With Sammy you can download your banking statements with your favorite e-mail client.

It collects account statements from your online banking accounts and makes them available as e-mail in its built-in POP3 server. The POP3 password is used to encrypt the banking access data, so the sensitive passwords will never be stored in plain text.
